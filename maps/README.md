Map files for tiptoi products
-----------------------------

The idea is to publish maps that visualize the OIDs of tiptoi
games. The maps are simple SVG drawings that overlay photos of the
tiptoi games. I do not want to publish these photos here. But for a
file <the book-the page>.svg you could place a photo of the page as
<the book-the page>.jgp and the written OIDs should line up with the
picture.

If you open the SVG in your browser you may click on the numbers and
tipplay started as

    tipplay -p 9980 <the book>.gme

on the same computer will emulate the tiptoi pen.
